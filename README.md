# 🛡️ Phishing Website Detection using Machine Learning

This project presents a comprehensive Machine Learning approach to detect phishing websites by analyzing various features of web pages. The goal is to improve cybersecurity by accurately identifying malicious websites and preventing users from falling victim to phishing attacks.

## 📌 Project Highlights

✅ Title: Phishing Website Detection: A Machine Learning Approach for Cybersecurity
🧠 Tech Used: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
📊 ML Models: Decision Tree, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN
🎯 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix
📄 Dataset: Extracted from open phishing datasets with URL-based and HTML-based features


## 🚀 Features

* Extracted domain-based, HTML-based, and behavior-based features from URLs
* Trained and tested multiple ML models to classify phishing vs legitimate sites
* Visualized model performance using graphs and confusion matrices
* Achieved high detection accuracy with Random Forest and Decision Tree classifiers
* Conducted feature importance analysis to interpret model decisions
